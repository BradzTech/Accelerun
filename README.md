# Accelerun

Accelerun is an iOS app that helps you keep in rhythm while exercising by changing the speed of your music to sync up with your steps.

It currently includes two music sources, the device music library and YouTube.

## Setup

1. Clone the project and open the .xcodeproj in Xcode 11.
2. Create a file Accelerun/Resources/Keys.plist. In it, create two string keys: "YouTube" for a YouTube Data API v3 key, and "Superpowered" for a Superpowered Audio key.
3. Build and run!
